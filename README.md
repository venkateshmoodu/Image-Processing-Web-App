# Image-Processing-Web-App
#Image Processing Web App: Cartoonify and Sketchify Your Photos

#Project Overview
The Image-Processing-Web-App is a simple web application that allows users to upload images and apply various image processing techniques like cartoonification and sketching. The app is built using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

#Features
Upload Images: Users can upload images from their local device.
Cartoonify: Converts the uploaded image into a cartoon-like image.
Sketchify: Converts the uploaded image into a pencil sketch.
View Processed Images: Users can view the original, cartoonified, and sketched versions of the uploaded image.

#Technology Stack
Backend: Python (Flask)
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Image Processing: OpenCV (Python library)

#Project Structure
app.py: The main Flask application file that handles routes and image processing logic.
templates: Directory containing HTML templates (index.html and result.html).
static: Directory for static files like CSS (style.css) and uploaded/processed images.

#Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required Python packages (Flask, OpenCV).
Run the Flask app.
Open the application in your browser and upload an image to see the processing results.

#Installation:
